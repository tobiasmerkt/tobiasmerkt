### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**tobiasmerkt/tobiasmerkt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Welcome to my GitHub profile! My journey began in business and data science, leading to a job as an AI analyst (data scientist role) at Accenture. Seeking to deepen my quantitative and software development skills, I pursued a bachelor's degree in physics while co-creating the Python package SwarmRL. Here, you'll find two main repositories:

- **SwarmRL**: A Python package designed for Physics researchers to explore reinforcement learning applications, such as using active matter to manipulate objects. The documentation is currently being expanded, but I'm happy to share example scripts and discuss potential applications. [Contact me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiasmerkt1) for more information.

- **Portfolio**: This repository showcases some of my projects, including `torch_rl_fight.py`, which offers insight into my coding structure and approach to problem-solving. It's a great starting point for recruiters and those interested in my work methodology. I'm also diving into several personal ML projects, like developing a chatbot that simulates conversations with my girlfriend. Stay tuned for these additions to the Portfolio repository.

Interested in collaborating or learning more about my work? Don't hesitate to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiasmerkt1) or contribute to SwarmRL.
